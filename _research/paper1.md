title: "The Working Capital Channel of Investment under Uncertainty"
collection: Working Papers
permalink: devinjhung.github.io/research/
excerpt: 'This study documents a novel working capital channel of investment under uncertainty, wherein uncertainty affects investment not through adjustment costs or irreversibility but through working capital and cash flows. The uncertainty comes from a prevalent supply chain phenomenon known as the bullwhip effect, where demand volatility is amplified upstream along the supply chain from retailers to raw materials suppliers.'
